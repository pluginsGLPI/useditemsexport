This plugin allows you to declare and follow (by entity) the consumptions of different credit vouchers directly from the Ticket form. To do it, you must follow these steps:

* Creation of different types of credit vouchers (as GLPI dropdown);
* Creation, in Entity tab, of the credit vouchers available for these entities;
* Declaration / Modification / Deletion of a consumption in the Ticket form and tab;
* Consultation of the vouchers sold, the remaining credits, credits consumptions from the Ticket form or from Entity tab.
